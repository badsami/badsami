## Hi, I'm Sami :wave:

I'm a low-level game developer committed to fast, clear and reliable code that lasts with great attention to detail.  
I aim to enable boundless creativity with tailored and easy-to-use systems and tools that won't get in the way.

### Topics I am interested in and/or thrive to get familiar with
C & C++, game engines, data-oriented, optimisation, x86/ARM/PowerPC SIMD intrinsics and assembly, CPU dispatching, CPU inner workings, cross-platform code, Windows and Linux APIs, rendering, profiling, efficient memory management, multithreading, audio programming, network/socket programming, data compression, algorithmics, mathematics, graph theory, physics, bioinformatics, genomics, climate informatics, energy-efficient development practices/code/hardware, hardware repair and diagnostic software
