## Hi, I'm Sami :wave:

I'm a low-level game programmer committed to providing fast, reliable, efficient code that lasts.  
I aim to empower game designers, artists and programmers with performant, scalable and easy-to-use tools and systems.

### Topics I find fascinating or want to get into
C & C++, game engines, optimisation and performance, x86/ARM/PowerPC SIMD intrinsics and assembly, CPU dispatching, CPU inner workings, cross-platform code, Windows and Linux APIs, profiling, efficient memory management, multithreading, audio programming, network/socket programming, data compression, algorithmics, mathematics, graph theory, physics, energy-efficient development practices/code/hardware, hardware repair and diagnostic software

### People I look up to for their work and programming philosophy
- The [Handmade Network](https://handmade.network/) and [Handmade Conferences](https://handmadecities.com/)
- [Casey Muratori](https://handmadehero.org/)
